Kubernetes support certificate based authentication.
and role based access control

In order to do some action in kubernetes cluster one need to identify to the apiserver.
Steps to be followed:

1. Create a private key.

> openssl genrsa -out filename.key 
''' it will generate a private key using rsa algorithm '''

2. Create a certificate using this key.

> openssl req -new -key filename.key -out filename.csr ( Certificate Signing Request)
''' it will create a certificate from the key generated in first step and store it in encoded format in filename.csr '''

3. Copy this csr in the master node.

4. In master node, we need to sign this certificate and create the filename.crt file.

> openssl x509 -req -in filename.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out filename.crt 
''' it will sign the csr with the ca and ca key and create srl and the important file which is the signed certificate crt(Chinese Remainder Theorem)'''

5. Copy this filename.crt to the workstation or client system.

6. Create the config file example file: 08_config.yml

then use the context 

> kubectl config use-context ContextName --kubeconfig configFile.yml
